# MVC

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** framework is an architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components *Model*, *View*, and *Controller*. 

Each architectural component is built to handle specific development aspects of an application. It isolates the business logic and presentation layer from each other.
